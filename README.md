## New instructions

Run `./run.sh` or just `cargo build` or such like.

## Old instructions

To build:
- Download wasmtime binary and extract to vendor/wasmtime
- Download sdl and build and install to vendor/sdl
- Run `./build.sh` from top project dir

I probable should make a build.zig, but this was working for now.
